# 📝 To-Do List App

A simple and interactive **To-Do List web application** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app helps you manage your daily tasks with the ability to **add**, **edit**, **complete**, **delete**, and **persist tasks** using the browser's `localStorage`.

## 🚀 Demo

Try it locally by opening `index.html` in your browser.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add new tasks with timestamps
- ✏️ Edit existing tasks
- ✔️ Mark tasks as completed (strike-through and disable)
- ❌ Delete tasks from the list and `localStorage`
- 💾 Save tasks to `localStorage` (even after page reload)
- ♻️ Automatically loads all saved tasks on page load
- 🌗 Dark Mode Toggle Feature
   This project includes a Dark Mode / Light Mode toggle to enhance user experience and accessibility. A toggle button in the top-right corner lets users switch       between themes. The selected mode is saved using localStorage, so your preferred theme persists even after refreshing or reopening the browser.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Markup and structure
- **CSS** – Basic styling
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Logic and interactivity
- **localStorage** – Persistent storage in browser
